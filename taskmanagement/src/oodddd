Let's review the code and ensure that everything is implemented correctly for Step 2 of the projectâ€”User Registration and Authentication. I'll verify each component and provide instructions on how to test everything using Postman.

1. Application Properties
application.properties looks fine. Ensure that the jwt.secret property has a secure value, and the database configuration matches your local setup.

2. Security Configuration
SecurityConfig:

Your configuration looks correct. The SecurityFilterChain is set up to disable CSRF, permit registration and login without authentication, and enforce stateless sessions.
The JwtFilter is added before the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter, which is correct for JWT-based authentication.
The PasswordEncoder bean is correctly defined.
The configureGlobal method uses userDetailsService and passwordEncoder, which is correct.
Potential Issue:

The configureGlobal method should be included in the SecurityConfig class and properly wired.
3. User Controller
UserController:

The registerUser and loginUser methods are correct for handling user registration and login, respectively.
registerUser should accept user credentials and create a new user.
loginUser should validate the user's credentials and return a JWT token.
Potential Issues:

You might want to handle exceptions more gracefully and provide a proper response for invalid credentials.
4. User Service
UserService:

registerUser correctly creates and saves a new user with an encoded password.
findByUsername retrieves a user by their username, which is used for authentication.
Potential Issues:

Ensure passwordEncoder is properly injected. If using @Autowired, it should work fine.
5. User Repository
UserRepository:

The findByUsername method should match the findByUsername method in your controller and service.
Potential Issues:

Make sure the method signature matches in all places (Username should be username for consistency).
6. JWT Utility
JwtUtil:

The JWT methods are correctly implemented for generating, extracting claims, and validating tokens.
7. JWT Filter
JwtFilter:

The filter correctly extracts the token, validates it, and sets authentication in the security context.
Potential Issues:

Ensure the filter is correctly added to the security filter chain and properly handles the Authorization header.
Testing with Postman
Here's how to test each functionality using Postman:

1. Register User
Endpoint: POST /api/register

Parameters:

username: testuser
password: password123
Request Example:


Expected Response: The response should return the registered user object with a hashed password.

2. Login User
Endpoint: POST /api/login

Parameters:

username: testuser
password: password123
Request Example:


Expected Response: The response should return a JWT token if the credentials are valid.

3. Access Secured Endpoint
Endpoint: GET /api/secured-endpoint (or any other secured endpoint you implement)

Headers:

Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
Request Example:


Expected Response: The secured endpoint should return the requested data if the JWT token is valid. Otherwise, it should return an unauthorized error.

Summary
Configuration: Ensure all configurations are correct and components are properly wired.
Endpoints: Test registration and login endpoints to ensure they work as expected.
JWT: Validate JWT token handling by accessing secured endpoints.
If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to register users, log in to receive JWT tokens, and access secured endpoints using Postman. If you encounter issues, verify each component and ensure that exceptions are handled properly.
